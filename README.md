Built a binary image classifier using convolutional neural network layers in TensorFlow/Keras
This classifies images of dandelion and grass.
We have added a 5 subsequent layers of convolutional 2D layer along with max pooling layer that halves the dimension  and used the activation as ReLU.
Finally, we have flattened the output of the CNN layers, fed into a fully-connected layer, and then to a sigmoid layer for binary classification.
